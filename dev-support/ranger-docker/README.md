## Overview

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have recent version of Docker installed from [docker.io](http://www.docker.io) (as of this writing: Engine 20.10.5, Compose 1.28.5).
   Make sure to configure docker with at least 6gb of memory.

2. Set this folder as your working directory.

3. Update environment variables in .env file, if necessary

4. Execute following command to download necessary archives to setup Ranger/HDFS/Hive/HBase/Kafka/Knox services:
     ./download-archives.sh

5. Build and deploy Apache Ranger in containers using docker-compose

   5.1. Execute following command to build Apache Ranger:

        docker-compose -f docker-compose.ranger-base.yml -f docker-compose.ranger-build.yml up

   Time taken to complete the build might vary (upto an hour), depending on status of ${HOME}/.m2 directory cache.

   5.2. Execute following command to start Ranger, Ranger enabled HDFS/YARN/HBase/Hive/Kafka/Knox and dependent services (Solr, DB) in containers:

        docker-compose -f docker-compose.ranger-base.yml -f docker-compose.ranger.yml -f docker-compose.ranger-hadoop.yml -f docker-compose.ranger-hbase.yml -f docker-compose.ranger-kafka.yml -f docker-compose.ranger-hive.yml -f docker-compose.ranger-knox.yml up -d

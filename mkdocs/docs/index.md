- Fine-grained authorization to do a specific action and/or operation with 20+ data processing services and managed through a central administration tool.
- Standardized authorization method across different data processing services.
- Enhanced support for different authorization methods like:
    - Role based access control (RBAC)
    - Attribute based access control (ABAC)
    - Tag based access control (TBAC)
- Centralized auditing of user access and administrative actions (security related) for all services.

<p>
When downloading from a mirror please check the SHA1/MD5 checksums as well
as verifying the OpenPGP compatible signature available from the main Apache
site. The <a href="https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/ranger/KEYS">KEYS</a>
file contains the public keys used for signing the release. It is recommended
that a web of trust is used to confirm the identity of these keys.
</p>
<p>
You can check the OpenPGP compatible signature with GnuPG via:
<ul>
<li>gpg --import KEYS</li>
<li>gpg --verify apache-ranger-*.tar.gz.asc</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The digests are stored in the file called 'apache-ranger-*.tar.gz.mds'. You can verify the digests by using a tool like md5sum or sha1sum as follows:
<ul>
<li>md5sum apache-ranger-*.tar.gz (and compare output to the relevant digest in apache-ranger-*.tar.gz.mds)</li>
<li>sha1sum apache-ranger-*.tar.gz (and compare output to the relevant digest in apache-ranger-*.tar.gz.mds)</li>
</ul>

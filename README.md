#### NOTE
Ranger is currently NOT setup to use pull requests (PRs) on GitHub to take in the changes for commit.
Please use the [apache review board](https://reviews.apache.org) to submit your code changes for review and commit.
Also create a [ranger jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER) to go along with the review and mention it in the review board review.


## Building Ranger in Docker (Sandbox Install)

Ranger is built using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). To run Ranger:

1. Check out the code from GIT [repository](https://github.com/apache/ranger.git)

2. Ensure that docker & docker-compose is installed and running on your system.

3. Ensure that JDK 1.8+ is installed on your system.

4. Ensure that Apache Maven is installed on your system.

5. Run the following command to build & run Ranger from Docker

   `./ranger_in_docker up`

6. After successful completion of the above command, you should be able to view Ranger Admin Console by using URL:
   ```
    http://<hostname-of-system>:6080/

    UserName: admin
    Password: rangerR0cks!
   ```

## Regular Build Process

1. Check out the code from GIT repository

2. On the root folder, please execute the following Maven command:

   `mvn clean compile package install`

   `mvn eclipse:eclipse`

   Ranger Admin UI tests depend on PhantomJS. If the build fails with npm or Karma errors you can either:
   - install PhantomJS dependencies for your platform (bzip2 and fontconfig)
   - skip JavaScript test execution: mvn -DskipJSTests ...

3. After the above build command execution, you should see the following TAR files in the target folder:
   ```
   ranger-<version>-admin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-atlas-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-hbase-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-hdfs-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-hive-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-kafka-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-kms.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-knox-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-migration-util.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-ranger-tools.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-solr-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-sqoop-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-src.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-storm-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-tagsync.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-usersync.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-yarn-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-kylin-plugin.tar.gz
   ranger-<version>-elasticsearch-plugin.tar.gz
   ```

## Importing Apache Ranger Project into Eclipse

1. Create an Eclipse workspace called 'ranger'

2. Import maven project from the root directory where ranger source code is downloaded (and build)


## Deployment Process


### Installation Host Information

   - HDFS Plugin needs to be installed on Name Node hosts.
   - Hive Plugin needs to be installed on HiveServer2 hosts.

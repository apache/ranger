 * This class exists only to provide for seamless upgrade/downgrade capabilities.  Coprocessor name is in hbase config files in /etc/.../conf which

 * this shell class serves to allow for seamles upgrade as well as downgrade.

 * This class is final because if one needs to customize coprocessor it is expected that RangerAuthorizationCoprocessor would be modified/extended as that is
 * the "real" coprocessor!  This class, hence, should NEVER be more than an EMPTY shell!

# Dynamic ingestor registry for Ranger audit-ingestor — guide for everyone

This guide explains **why** and **how** Ranger moves from **static** ingestor configuration (XML at startup) to a **dynamic unified registry** at runtime — **without restarting** audit-ingestor.

It covers both:

1. **Kafka partition routing** — which plugin uses which `ranger_audits` partitions  
2. **Service allowlist** — which principals may `POST /api/audit/access` for each Ranger repo  

Both live in one Kafka document on **`ranger_audit_partition_plan`** (`plugins`, `buffer`, and `services`). One REST API: **`/api/audit/partition-plan`**.

It is written for operators, architects, and reviewers who need a shared mental model — **without reading the codebase**.

**Confluence:** [Dynamic Ingestor Registry Guide (Ranger Audit Ingestor)](https://cloudera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/12043681813) (child of [Ranger Engineering](https://cloudera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/759726545/Ranger+Engineering))

**Related design docs:** [README-DYNAMIC-SERVICE-ALLOWLIST-DESIGN.md](README-DYNAMIC-SERVICE-ALLOWLIST-DESIGN.md) · [DESIGN-KAFKA-DYNAMIC-PARTITIONING.md](DESIGN-KAFKA-DYNAMIC-PARTITIONING.md)

## 1. What problem are we solving?

Ranger plugins (HDFS, Hive, Trino, Ozone OM, etc.) send audit events to **audit-ingestor**, which writes them to Kafka (`ranger_audits`).

Ingestor performs **two** configuration jobs:

| Job | Question | Static today | Dynamic goal |
|-----|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Service allowlist** | May this Kerberos principal POST audits claiming repo `R`? | XML `service.<repo>.allowed.users` at startup | `services` map in unified registry |
| **Partition routing** | After accept, which Kafka partition? | XML `configured.plugins` at startup | `plugins` / `buffer` in unified registry |

**Today (static mode):**

- Allowlist and partition layout are defined in **XML** at startup.
- Adding a repo or plugin usually means: edit XML → **restart ingestor** on every pod.

**Goal (dynamic mode):**

- Change allowlist **and** partition assignments **while ingestor is running**.
- Onboard a new plugin/repo without reshuffling existing partition assignments (append-only).
- Keep all ingestor replicas consistent via one shared Kafka compacted topic.

---

## 2. Core ideas (plain language)

### Kafka topic partitions

Think of a Kafka topic as a queue split into numbered lanes: partition `0`, `1`, `2`, …

- Each audit event is routed to **one** partition based on the plugin id (Kafka record **key**).
- More partitions → more parallel consumption downstream (Solr/HDFS dispatchers).

Kafka allows **increasing** partition count; it does **not** support shrinking.

### Plugin id

The plugin id (also called agent id / app id) identifies the source of the audit — e.g. `hdfs`, `hiveServer2`, `trino`.

### Partition plan (unified registry document)

A **partition plan** is a versioned JSON document stored in `ranger_audit_partition_plan`. It answers:

- For each known plugin: **which partition numbers** may receive its audits? (`plugins` + `buffer`)
- For each Ranger service repo: **which short usernames** may `POST /access`? (`services`)
- What is the current **`topicPartitionCount`** (must match Kafka)?

Example (simplified):

```json
{
  "topic": "ranger_audits",
  "version": 12,
  "topicPartitionCount": 48,
  "plugins": {
    "hdfs":        { "partitions": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] },
    "hiveServer2": { "partitions": [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] }
  },
  "buffer": { "partitions": [12, 13, 14, "... through 47 ..."] },
  "services": {
    "dev_hive":  { "allowedUsers": ["hive"] },
    "dev_ozone": { "allowedUsers": ["om", "ozone"] },
    "dev_trino": { "allowedUsers": ["trino"] }
  }
}
```

The `version` field increments on every successful admin change (optimistic locking) — **one version** for routing and allowlist mutations.

Every ingestor pod uses the **same** document so routing and authorization stay consistent.

### Service allowlist (`POST /api/audit/access`)

Plugins authenticate (Kerberos/JWT), then ingestor checks `services[serviceName].allowedUsers` (short names after `auth_to_local`). Failure → **403** before any Kafka produce. This check is **orthogonal** to partition routing but stored in the **same** registry document when dynamic mode is on.

### Unified registry (source of truth)

The live plan lives in **durable shared storage** that all ingestor replicas read — a Kafka **compacted** topic (`ranger_audit_partition_plan`).

- No new database or ZooKeeper dependency.
- Survives pod restarts.
- All replicas see the same latest plan.

### Append-only growth

When a plugin needs more capacity:

1. Increase the audit topic’s partition count (add lanes at the **tail**).
2. Assign **only the new** partition numbers to that plugin.
3. **Do not** move partitions away from other plugins.

### Buffer partitions

Plugins not yet in the plan (or newly appearing in the fleet) go to **buffer** partitions until an operator **promotes** them to dedicated partitions.

---

## 3. Today vs proposed (at a glance)

| | Static (today) | Dynamic (unified registry) |
|---|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Where config lives** | XML on each pod at startup | `ranger_audit_partition_plan` (`plugins` + `services`) |
| **Change allowlist or routing** | Edit XML + restart | `/api/audit/partition-plan` REST; no restart |
| **Add new plugin/repo** | XML + restart | `POST .../plugins` (onboard with mandatory `services`) |
| **Scale hot plugin** | Edit overrides + restart | `PATCH .../plugins/{pluginId}` (append-only tail partitions) |
| **Multi-replica ingestor** | Same XML if synced via ConfigMap | All pods watch same Kafka document |
| **Feature flag** | Default behavior | `ranger.audit.ingestor.kafka.partition.plan.dynamic.enabled=true` |

---

## 4. Static → dynamic cutover — direct answers

**Goal:** Turn on dynamic mode so each plugin keeps sending audits to the **same Kafka partitions** it uses today — no surprise rerouting on cutover day.

### When dynamic mode is off

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is `ranger_audit_partition_plan` created? | **No** — the plan topic is not created or used. |
| How is routing decided? | From XML at startup (static mode), same as today. |
| Is there a background plan sync? | **No**. |

### When dynamic mode is on

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is the plan topic created? | **Yes** — on first startup that needs the registry. |
| Where does every ingestor get the plan? | From `ranger_audit_partition_plan` (compacted topic), kept in memory on each pod. |
| Can XML edits change live routing? | **No** (once a plan message exists in Kafka). Runtime changes go through REST. |

### How “same partitions per plugin” is achieved on cutover

Ingestor does **not** read Kafka to discover which plugin owns which partition. Kafka stores audit **records**, not plugin ownership.

Preservation works because the **first published plan** uses the **same layout rules as static mode**:

| Piece | Static today | Dynamic (first plan from XML) |
|-------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Plugin order | `configured.plugins` list | Same list |
| Partitions per plugin | Default + per-plugin overrides | Same |
| Layout | Contiguous ranges (hdfs → 0–2, next → 3–5, … buffer tail) | Same ranges as explicit partition ID lists |
| Within-plugin pick | Round-robin per plugin id | Same round-robin |
| Unknown plugin | Hash into buffer | Same buffer pool |

**What Kafka is used for at bootstrap:**

| Step | Reads from | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| Build first plan (empty registry) | **XML only** | Plugin list, overrides, buffer → partition lists |
| Install plan (every pod) | **Kafka AdminClient** on `ranger_audits` | **Total** partition count only — must match `topicPartitionCount` in plan |
| Route each audit | **In-memory plan** | No per-event Kafka read |

**Brownfield (existing production cluster):** Auto-bootstrap from XML is safe only when **XML, ingestor startup logs, and `kafka-topics --describe ranger_audits` all agree**. If they differ, **pre-load the plan into Kafka before enabling dynamic** (operator publishes JSON to the plan topic while dynamic is still off).

### Plan already in Kafka vs empty registry

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Pod as Ingestor pod
  participant Plan as ranger_audit_partition_plan
  participant Audits as ranger_audits
  participant XML as site.xml

  Pod->>Plan: create plan topic if missing (Race A)
  Pod->>Plan: read plan for key ranger_audits
  alt plan message exists
    Plan-->>Pod: use stored plan — skip XML bootstrap
  else registry empty
    Pod->>XML: build first plan from XML (plugins + services)
    Pod->>Plan: re-read (Race B — peer may have published)
    Pod->>Plan: publish first plan if still empty
    Pod->>Plan: mandatory read-back
  end
  Pod->>Audits: describe topic — partition count
  Pod->>Pod: validate count matches plan → load into memory
```

| Situation | What each pod does |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Plan **message** already in `ranger_audit_partition_plan` | Read and use it; **do not** publish a new plan from XML |
| Plan topic exists but **no message** yet | One pod publishes the first plan; others re-read and adopt the same plan (**Race B**) |
| Several pods create the plan **topic** at once | Idempotent create — **Race A**; “already exists” is success |

**Bootstrap logic (summary):** read plan → if missing, build from XML → re-read → publish if still missing → mandatory read-back → validate partition count → install in memory.

After the first plan is stored in Kafka, **Kafka is the source of truth** for routing.

### Multi-pod race — is it implemented?

| Race | Scenario | Resolution |
|------|----------|------------|
| **A** | Several pods create `ranger_audit_partition_plan` topic together | Idempotent topic create |
| **B** | Several pods publish the **first** plan when registry is empty | Re-read before and after publish; all pods install the same plan from Kafka |

**Your rule:** *If the plan topic exists but no plan message → add the plan; otherwise use the plan from the topic* — **Yes, implemented** via the bootstrap flow above.

---

## 5. How dynamic mode works (end-to-end)

| Plane | Kafka topic | Traffic | Who reads/writes |
|-------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **Data** | `ranger_audits` | High — every audit event | Plugins → ingestor → dispatchers |
| **Control (unified registry)** | `ranger_audit_partition_plan` (compacted) | Low — rare routing + allowlist changes | `/api/audit/partition-plan` REST + `PartitionPlanWatcher` |

The registry is **configuration**, not audit data. Ingestor keeps the current document **in memory**; only the watcher and REST handlers touch the plan topic.

### Architecture (control plane vs data plane)

```mermaid

  subgraph plugins [Ranger plugins]

  end

  Admin -->|via load balancer| REST
  Svc -->|createPartitions if needed| AuditTopic
  AuditTopic --> Solr

```

### First startup — seeding the plan (once per cluster)

When dynamic mode starts and the plan registry is **empty**:

1. Ingestor enables dynamic mode.
2. Watcher finds no document in `ranger_audit_partition_plan`.
3. Ingestor reads XML (`configured.plugins` if set, else buffer-only bootstrap from `kafka.topic.partitions`; overrides, buffer, and `service.*.allowed.users`).
4. Ingestor builds and publishes the **first document** (`plugins` + `services`) to the compacted topic.
5. Ingestor loads that document into memory and begins enforcing allowlist + routing.

**After that:** additional pods and restarts **read Kafka only** — they do not re-build from XML.

### Every audit — the hot path

The plan topic is **not** read on this path.

```text
Plugin POST /api/audit/access?serviceName=dev_hive&appId=hiveServer2
        │
        ├─ 401  Authentication failed
        ├─ 403  services[dev_hive] does not include short username → STOP
        └─ 200/202  Allowlist passed → partition router → ranger_audits
```

1. Plugin POSTs audit to ingestor (authenticate).
2. `isAllowedServiceUser` reads **in-memory** `services` map (or static XML when dynamic off).
3. Partition router reads **in-memory** `plugins` / `buffer`.
4. Known plugin → round-robin within its partition list; unknown → buffer.
5. Record written to `ranger_audits`.

### Changing the plan — admin or automation

**On the pod that receives the REST call:**

1. Read current plan from Kafka.
2. Validate append-only rules.
3. Grow `ranger_audits` tail if needed (Kafka AdminClient).
4. Write new plan **version** to compacted topic.
5. Return **200 OK** or **409 Conflict** (stale `expectedVersion`).

**On every ingestor pod (~30s sync interval):**

1. Background sync picks up new plan version.
2. Validates against live `ranger_audits` partition count.
3. Swaps plan in memory — **no restart**.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Admin as Admin / automation
  participant REST as Ingestor REST (one pod)
  participant Plan as ranger_audit_partition_plan
  participant Audit as ranger_audits
  participant W as Background sync (each pod)
  participant Mem as In-memory plan
  participant Part as Partition router

  Admin->>REST: POST /plugins or PATCH /plugins/{id}
  REST->>Plan: read current plan version
  REST->>Audit: createPartitions (if needed)
  REST->>Plan: write new plan version
  REST-->>Admin: 200 OK

  loop Every ingestor pod
    W->>Plan: poll latest plan
    W->>Mem: atomic swap
    Note over Part,Mem: Hot path reads memory only
    Part->>Audit: produce audit (key = plugin id)
  end
```

### Rules to remember

- **Two topics, two jobs** — plan topic = unified config (`plugins` + `services`); audit topic = data.
- **Memory on the hot path** — no per-audit read of the plan topic.
- **Kafka is the source of truth** after the first document is published.
- **Append-only growth** — new partitions only at the tail of `ranger_audits`.
- **All pods must agree** — every ingestor syncs from the same compacted topic.
- **Allowlist and routing are separate checks** — 403 on `/access` is allowlist; wrong partition is routing.

---

## 6. Admin REST API (control plane)

When dynamic mode is on, operators change routing **and** allowlists through **`/api/audit/partition-plan`** on **any** pod (usually via load balancer). Mutations are written to `ranger_audit_partition_plan`; every pod picks up changes through `PartitionPlanWatcher` (~30s).

**Auth:** Kerberos or JWT. When `kafka.partition.plan.allowed.users` is set, only those short names may call partition-plan REST (plugin users must not). Dynamic mode off → all partition-plan calls return **503**.

### Endpoints (three only)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/audit/partition-plan` | Read current plan (`plugins`, `buffer`, `services`, `version`) |
| `POST` | `/api/audit/partition-plan/plugins` | **Onboard** plugin: dedicated partitions + service allowlists (one version bump) |
| `PATCH` | `/api/audit/partition-plan/plugins/{pluginId}` | **Update** onboarded plugin: scale and/or service allowlist mutations |

Base URL example: `https://<ingestor-host>:7081/api/audit/partition-plan`

All mutations require **`expectedVersion`** from the last `GET`. Stale version → **409 Conflict** + current plan in body.

**Removed (consolidated above):** `PATCH /api/audit/partition-plan`, `POST /api/audit/partition-plan/services`, separate promote-only / scale-only flows.

> **Future work (not implemented):** bootstrap **v0** split — seeding `services` from XML separately from plugin partition assignments. Current bootstrap still publishes a single v1 plan from XML.

### Common operations

**Read plan**

```http
GET /api/audit/partition-plan
→ 200 + JSON plan (note the "version" field)
```

**Onboard plugin** — dedicated partitions + allowlists in one call (`services` is **required** and must be non-empty):

```json
POST /api/audit/partition-plan/plugins
{
  "pluginId": "hiveServer2",
  "partitionCount": 3,
  "expectedVersion": 1,
  "services": {
    "dev_hive":  { "allowedUsers": ["hive"] },
    "dev_hive2": { "allowedUsers": ["hive2"] }
  }
}
```

Each service entry is stored with `pluginId` for ownership tracking.

**Update plugin** — scale and/or mutate allowlists scoped to `{pluginId}` (at least one delta required):

```json
PATCH /api/audit/partition-plan/plugins/hiveServer2
{
  "expectedVersion": 2,
  "addServices":    { "dev_hive3": { "allowedUsers": ["hive3"] } },
  "removeServices": ["dev_hive2"],
  "additionalPartitions": 2
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `additionalPartitions` | int ≥ 1 — append tail partition IDs (append-only) |
| `addServices` | map repo → `{ "allowedUsers": [...] }` |
| `updateServices` | map repo → `{ "allowedUsers": [...] }` — replace allowlist for repos owned by `{pluginId}` |
| `removeServices` | list of repo names to remove (scoped to `{pluginId}`) |

Success → **200** + updated plan JSON (version incremented on change).  
Repeating the same onboard or update delta (with matching `expectedVersion`) → **200** + current plan JSON with **no** registry write or version bump.  
State conflict (resource exists but request differs, e.g. different partition count) → **400**.  
Stale version → **409** + current plan in body.

### What happens inside one REST call

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Admin[Admin or script] --> REST[Ingestor REST]
  REST --> Read[Read plan from Kafka]
  Read --> Check{expectedVersion OK?}
  Check -->|No| R409[409 + current plan]
  Check -->|Yes| Valid[Validate append-only change]
  Valid --> Grow{Need more audit partitions?}
  Grow -->|Yes| Topic[Grow ranger_audits tail]
  Grow -->|No| Write[Write new plan to Kafka]
  Topic --> Write
  Write --> OK[200 + new plan]
  OK --> Sync[All pods sync within ~30s]
```

| Step | What the ingestor does |
|------|------------------------|
| 1 | Authenticate caller; check `kafka.partition.plan.allowed.users` when configured |
| 2 | Read current plan from `ranger_audit_partition_plan` |
| 3 | Reject if `expectedVersion` does not match |
| 4 | Compute new plugin lists (append-only — no reshuffling existing slots) |
| 5 | If new partition IDs are needed → grow `ranger_audits` **first** |
| 6 | Publish new plan version to Kafka |
| 7 | Return updated plan JSON |

**GET** is cheap (memory). **POST / PATCH** always goes through Kafka so all pods converge on the same plan.

---

## 7. Operator workflow: onboarding a plugin or repo

**Recommended:** one `POST /api/audit/partition-plan/plugins` with a **non-empty `services` map** — allowlist and dedicated partitions in one plan version.

### Stage 0 — Create service in Ranger Admin

1. Create service `dev_trino` in Policy Manager; set `policy.download.auth.users`.
2. Configure plugin audit destination → ingestor URL (`:7081`).

### Stage 1 — Onboard via unified registry

```http
POST /api/audit/partition-plan/plugins
```

Include `pluginId`, `partitionCount`, `expectedVersion`, and at least one repo in `services` (see [§6](#6-admin-rest-api-control-plane)).

All ingestors apply within ~30s. **No restart** required.

### Stage 2 — Verify plugin POST

Expect **200/202** on `/access`, not **403**.

### Stage 3 — Scale or change allowlists (optional)

Call `PATCH /api/audit/partition-plan/plugins/{pluginId}` to add tail partitions, add/update/remove repos, or combine all in one version bump.

**Do not** edit `ranger-audit-ingestor-site.xml` on one pod for runtime changes. XML is only for **initial bootstrap** when the registry is empty.

---

## 8. Operator workflow: partition-only changes

Use when an onboarded plugin already has allowlists and you only need routing changes (scale tail partitions).

### Stage 0 — Plugin appears (unknown)

- Audits use **buffer** partitions.
- Monitor volume per plugin id.

### Stage 1 — Onboard plugin (partitions + allowlists)

- Call `POST /api/audit/partition-plan/plugins` with mandatory `services` (see [§6](#6-admin-rest-api-control-plane)).
- All ingestors apply within ~30s. **No restart** required.

### Stage 2 — Scale a hot plugin

- Call `PATCH /api/audit/partition-plan/plugins/{pluginId}` with `additionalPartitions`.
- Dispatchers rebalance automatically when the audit topic grows.

**Do not** edit `ranger-audit-ingestor-site.xml` on one pod for runtime changes. XML is only for **initial bootstrap** when the plan registry is empty.

---

## 9. Configuration (dynamic mode)

| Property | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ranger.audit.ingestor.kafka.partition.plan.dynamic.enabled` | Turn dynamic unified registry on/off | `false` (default) = static XML |
| `ranger.audit.ingestor.kafka.partition.plan.topic` | Compacted registry topic name | `ranger_audit_partition_plan` |
| `ranger.audit.ingestor.kafka.partition.plan.refresh.interval.ms` | How often pods reload plan | `30000` |
| `ranger.audit.ingestor.kafka.partition.plan.allowed.users` | Who may call partition-plan REST | `admin,ops` |
| `ranger.audit.ingestor.service.<repo>.allowed.users` | Static bootstrap per-repo allowlist | `hive`, `om,ozone`, … |
| `ranger.audit.ingestor.auth.to.local` | Principal → short name rules | Same as Hadoop `hadoop.security.auth_to_local` |

When dynamic is **off**, routing and allowlist are fixed from XML at startup; the plan topic is not used.

When dynamic is **on** and the registry is **empty**, the first ingestor pod seeds the plan (`plugins` + `services`) from XML. Later pods and restarts read **Kafka only**.

---

## 10. FAQ

### Basics

**Why plugin-based partitioning?**  
Hot plugins (HDFS, Hive) can get dedicated Kafka lanes so they do not starve others. Unknown plugins share a buffer until you promote them.

**What is the difference between static and dynamic mode?**  
Static: routing is computed once from XML at startup; changes need restart. Dynamic: routing lives in Kafka; admins change it via REST while ingestor keeps running.

**Why not store the plan in Postgres or ZooKeeper?**  
Ingestor already requires Kafka. A compacted plan topic adds no new infrastructure.

**Why not edit XML on a running pod?**  
Each pod has its own copy; edits are not shared, not durable, and are lost on restart. Runtime changes belong in the plan topic via REST.

**Can I change routing by editing XML while dynamic mode is on?**  
No for live routing. Ingestor uses the Kafka plan in memory, not XML edits on disk. Update XML only when preparing static rollback or documenting the intended layout.

**Can I decrease `ranger_audits` partition count?**  
No. Kafka does not support shrinking partitions. You can only add partitions at the tail.

### Two topics and sync

**What are the two Kafka topics?**  
`ranger_audits` = audit data (high volume). `ranger_audit_partition_plan` = routing config (low volume, compacted).

**Does every audit POST read the plan topic?**  
No. Each audit uses the plan already in **memory** on that pod. Only background sync and REST mutations touch the plan topic.

**How do all ingestor pods stay in sync?**  
Every pod watches the same compacted plan topic (default every 30s) and swaps the new plan into memory.

**What happens when a pod restarts?**  
It reads the latest plan from Kafka (if dynamic is on). The plan survives in Kafka across crashes.

**Do Solr and HDFS dispatchers need the partition plan?**  
No. They consume **all** partitions of `ranger_audits`. Only ingestor uses the plan to **choose** which partition to write to.

**Will changing the plan break consumers?**  
Adding partitions triggers normal consumer rebalance. Existing plugin slots keep the same partition numbers if you follow append-only promote/scale rules.

### Plan content and routing

**What is the buffer?**  
Partitions reserved for plugins that are not yet promoted (or newly seen plugin ids). Promote moves a plugin from buffer to dedicated slots.

**What does append-only mean?**  
When scaling, only **new** partition numbers at the end of `ranger_audits` are assigned. Existing plugins keep the same partition IDs in the same order.

**How is a partition chosen inside a plugin’s list?**  
Round-robin per plugin id — same behavior as static mode.

**Where does an unknown plugin send audits?**  
To the buffer partition pool (hash-based pick within buffer list in dynamic mode).

### REST and concurrency

**Do I need to restart ingestor after promote or scale?**  
No. Background sync applies the new plan within about one refresh interval (~30s).

**What is `expectedVersion`?**  
The plan `version` you believe is current when you write. If someone else published first, your version is stale and you get **409**.

**What should I do on HTTP 409?**  
Another writer published a newer plan. Use the plan in the 409 response (or `GET` again), note the new `version`, and retry your change with that `expectedVersion`.

**Why grow `ranger_audits` before publishing a new plan?**  
The plan must not reference partition IDs that do not exist yet. The server grows the audit topic tail first, then writes the plan.

**Why does promote return 400?**  
Common cases: plugin already has dedicated partitions, invalid partition count, or plugin id missing. Scale returns 400 if the plugin is not in the plan yet (promote it first).

**What do the HTTP status codes mean?**  
**503** — dynamic mode is off, or the server could not grow `ranger_audits` (Kafka admin failure). **400** — validation failed (bad shape, append-only violation, `topicPartitionCount` ≠ Kafka). **409** — version conflict; retry with the plan body returned in the response.

**Do dispatchers need reconfiguration after scale?**  
No. Consumer groups rebalance automatically when partition count increases. Tune consumer threads only if you see sustained lag.

### Cutover and bootstrap

**When is `ranger_audit_partition_plan` created?**  
Only when dynamic mode is enabled. With dynamic off, the topic is not created or used.

**Does bootstrap read Kafka to learn plugin → partition mapping?**  
No. The first plan is built from XML (same layout as static mode). Kafka is used for **total** partition count validation and as the durable registry.

**Can I publish the plan to Kafka before enabling dynamic mode?**  
Yes — recommended for brownfield clusters. Ingestor will read your pre-loaded plan and will not replace it with a fresh XML bootstrap.

**Greenfield vs brownfield cutover — what is different?**  
Greenfield: enable dynamic on an empty registry; first pod seeds from XML (empty `configured.plugins` → buffer-only plan sized by `kafka.topic.partitions`). Brownfield: export static layout, pre-seed the plan topic (or set `configured.plugins` in XML to match production), then enable dynamic and verify every pod shows the same plan.

**Does the `configured.plugins` XML list still matter in dynamic mode?**  
Yes for **bootstrap only** when the registry is empty. After the first plan exists, runtime routing changes go through REST, not by editing that list.

**How do I verify cutover succeeded?**  
`GET /api/audit/partition-plan` on every pod (same `version`); plugin lists match your saved static logs; `topicPartitionCount` matches `kafka-topics --describe ranger_audits`.

**How do I roll back to static mode?**  
Export current plan via `GET`, align XML to that layout if needed, set `dynamic.enabled=false`, rolling restart. Plan topic remains but is ignored.

**What if multiple pods start together with an empty registry?**  
Race A: idempotent plan-topic create. Race B: re-read before/after first publish; all pods install the same plan. See [§4](#4-static--dynamic-cutover--direct-answers).

### Troubleshooting

**Ingestor fails startup after enabling dynamic — what now?**  
Often Kafka unreachable or cannot create/read the plan topic. Fix Kafka connectivity; keep dynamic off until Kafka is healthy. With Kafka down at startup, ingestor should **not** come up healthy in dynamic mode.

**Pods show different plan versions — what now?**  
Wait one refresh interval after a change. If still mismatched, check plan topic readability and watcher logs on the lagging pod.

**Does audit recovery / local spool behavior change?**  
No. Per-pod spool and retry when Kafka is briefly unavailable works as today.

**Does this replace producer throughput tuning?**  
No. Batch size, linger, and compression are separate settings.

**Who can call partition-plan REST?**  
Ops principals in `kafka.partition.plan.allowed.users` when configured (Kerberos/JWT). Plugin users (`hive`, `om`) send audits via `/access` — they must **not** mutate the registry.

### Service allowlist (`POST /api/audit/access`)

**Why do we need an allowlist if Kerberos already authenticates the plugin?**  
Authentication proves *who* connected. Authorization proves they may **claim audits for this repo**. Kerberos success alone would let any daemon POST as any `serviceName`.

**Does dynamic partition plan remove the allowlist check?**  
**No.** Partition routing runs **after** `/access` accepts the batch. **403** on `/access` is always a **service allowlist** failure (not routing).

**What is `serviceName`?**  
The Ranger Policy Manager **repo name** (e.g. `dev_hive`), not the service type (`hive`).

**What goes in `allowedUsers`?**  
Short names after `auth_to_local` — same values as `policy.download.auth.users` on the Ranger service (or a subset).

**Consistency rule (ops discipline):**  
`allowedUsers for repo R ⊆ { short names from policy.download.auth.users for R in Ranger Admin }`. Ranger Admin does not auto-sync in Phase 1; ingestor may reject REST writes that violate subset rules (strict mode).

**Three layers — do not merge:**

| Layer | Who | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **Service allowlist** (plugin POST) | Daemons (`hive`, `om`, …) | May this principal POST audits for repo `R`? |
| **Partition plan** (Kafka routing) | Ingestor internal | Which Kafka partition after accept? |
| **Admin REST APIs** | Ops (`admin`, `ops`, …) | Who may change the unified registry via `/api/audit/partition-plan`? |

**If you see…**

| Symptom | Layer | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **401** on `/access` | Authentication | Plugin / ingestor Kerberos, keytabs, SPNEGO |
| **403** on `/access` | **Service allowlist** | Add repo via `POST .../plugins` (onboard) or `PATCH .../plugins/{pluginId}` (`addServices` / `updateServices`) |
| Audits accepted but wrong Kafka partition | **Partition plan** | `POST .../plugins` (onboard) / `PATCH .../plugins/{pluginId}` (scale) |
| New repo in Admin, audits still **403** | Allowlist not onboarded | `POST .../plugins` or `PATCH .../plugins/{pluginId}` with `addServices` |
| Allowlist OK, audits in buffer partition | Partition plan not onboarded | `POST .../plugins` with `partitionCount` + `services` |

**Plugin gets 403 but Kerberos works — what now?**  
Short name not in `services[repo].allowedUsers`, wrong `serviceName`, or `auth_to_local` mismatch.

**New repo in Admin UI, still 403?**  
Creating the service in Admin does not auto-update ingestor (Phase 1). Call `POST /api/audit/partition-plan/plugins` (new plugin) or `PATCH .../plugins/{pluginId}` with `addServices`.

**Do I need both allowlist and partition plan for a new plugin?**  
Yes for full production onboarding. `POST /api/audit/partition-plan/plugins` requires a non-empty `services` map and assigns dedicated partitions in **one** plan version.

**Is there a bundled API?**  
`POST /api/audit/partition-plan/plugins` registers `services[repo]` allowlists and promotes plugin partitions atomically.
